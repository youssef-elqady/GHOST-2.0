# GHOST STATE

Last updated: 2026-11-12
Current sprint: 01 - Foundation review (codebase review in progress)

## Product and architecture decisions
- Primary UI: **Next.js** for both Staff and Admin.
- v0 is the UI design/build workflow owned by the user. Preserve the existing v0 visual direction; integrate screens into the existing `frontend/` app rather than creating a second production frontend.
- Design references:
  - Staff: https://github.com/youssef-elqady/ghost-staff
  - Admin: https://github.com/youssef-elqady/Admin-Dashboard
- Main repository: https://github.com/youssef-elqady/GHOST-2.0
- Backend remains .NET 10 Web API + SQL Server + EF Core. Financial calculations, permissions, stock, and session state remain server-authoritative.
- The existing `feature/frontend-v0-foundation` work is a reference/foundation to inspect and preserve; do not overwrite it blindly.
- No WPF client is planned for v1.

## Done
- SRS + ERD and business decisions BD-01 to BD-14 are documented.
- Skill and master prompt are committed.
- Existing GHOST-2.0 backend and Next.js frontend have been identified and reviewed at a high level.
- Local branch `feature/products-inventory-billing` was synchronized with origin at commit `dcc07c5`.

## In progress
- Sprint 01: compare current backend/frontend code and inventory branch against SRS/ERD; produce KEEP / MODIFY / ADD / DEFER decisions.
- Reconcile documentation with the actual Next.js Staff + Admin direction.
- Review the separate inventory foundation branch before any merge.

## Next steps
1. Finish the code-to-SRS diff, including auth, cash ledger, sessions, inventory, migrations, concurrency, and tests.
2. Confirm the exact v0 design inputs from the Staff and Admin reference repositories and preserve their visual language.
3. Define the API contracts needed by each frontend workflow; replace mock data gradually with backend-owned data.
4. Complete Sprint 01 review and get approval before structural changes.
5. Sprint 02: authentication, roles, business day, shifts, handover, cash transactions, and staff data scoping.
6. Continue with sessions/devices, then inventory/POS, reporting, audit/backup, and production readiness.

## Non-negotiable invariants
- Backend is authoritative for money, time-based billing, permissions, stock balance, and session state.
- No money calculations or authorization decisions in the browser.
- Financial and stock operations must be transactional, idempotent where appropriate, auditable, and concurrency-safe.
- No destructive Git operations or branch merges without review.
- Preserve Arabic RTL, GHOST branding, and the user's v0 design direction.

## Decisions still open
- Discount rounding policy.
- Withdrawal alert threshold.
- Rejected stock receipt handling choice (cash reversal vs staff shortage), per approved auditable flow.
- Printer model/driver details and camera count.
- Remaining implementation choices discovered during Sprint 01.
